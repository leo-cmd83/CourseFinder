# 🌍 Exchange Program Course Finder

A full-stack web platform built to help **Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science (GCS)** students at **Concordia University** find **equivalent courses** offered at partner universities around the world.  

This project simplifies the exchange process by allowing students to easily browse, filter, and compare courses based on their **major** and **target university**  removing the need to search manually through multiple documents.


## 🎯 Purpose

When Concordia students go on academic exchange, they must ensure that the courses they take abroad can be transferred back for credit at Concordia.  
This platform makes that process easy by centralizing all course equivalency information in one modern and interactive website.

It is especially built for **Gina Cody majors**, including:
- Software Engineering (**SOEN**)
- Computer Science (**COMP**)
- Electrical Engineering (**ELEC**)
- Computer Engineering (**COEN**)
- Mechanical Engineering (**MECH**)
- Mathematics & Statistics (**MAST**, **MATH**, **STAT**)
